            INTRO
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
            It all started Monday, July 16th, 2018 when I found out I didn't get an H1-B. It was some time in the afternoon, and my immediate reaction was "well, fuck me".
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
            But to be perfectly honest, I can't say I was surprised. I hadn't heard anything about my H1-B case and it was late July, so I had assumed that I wasn't going to get it. But some part of me was hoping for that last minute Hail Mary email from the lawyers — "Congrats!."
            But that never happened. Instead, my question about the cap-gap was answered by "Wait no you can't work anymore we just got your rejection notice."
            Oh, here's a special fuck you to people who posted about getting their H1-B on facebook. Firstly, who even posts on facebook anymore? Secondly, go fuck yourself.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
            Resignation aside, the prospect of moving to a new city was kind of exciting. I had my fair share of complaints about San Francisco. Dare I say I was thankful for the chance to leave?
            On July 26, I left for Vancouver with a suitcase full of clothes, 10lbs heavier from eating like a rabid child at a birthday party for a week and a half.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
          It's been nearly a week. In an attempt to not waste away as I wait for the next H1-B cycle and the pursuit of ~new skills~, I've decided to add a blog section to my half-baked Generic Digital Designer Internet One-Pager.
          So I'm gonna write. And it's going to be angry. It's going to be how I feel during this emotional roller coaster that I dub my "Vancouver Exile".
          This will be full of my existential qualms and complaints, and honestly, some very first world problems. I know I will come off as a complete ingrate sometimes.
          I'm not going to hold myself to any reliable schedule either. So most posts will likely be written in times of high emotional duress. Or when I feel like it. Like twitter. It might be TMI (though if you know about this blog link, it means I like you enough that I would have told you about this in person, or I guess via chat, anyway) and incredibly unorganized. But that's ok.

           JESUS FUCKING CHRIST I accidentally threw my intercom phone in the wash and it came out looking as crushed as my spirit. Ok. That's hyperbole, but it was BAD. The screen was cracked and bent beyond imaginable repair
           (as you'd expect for a $100 phone that was pummelled and waterlogged in a drum for an hour...speaking of which, throwing a person in a modified washing machine would be peak cruel and unusual torture).
           For some reason I popped the battery back in, and this miserable, broken phone still had enough in it for the flashlight to turn on. That's resilience (or good engineering, I guess?) if I've ever seen it. Honestly same. Me. Relatable content. Dear god. That was the second LG K4 phone I've gone through in a week.
           One stolen, one annhilated by my washing machine. Quarter life crisis indeed.

          Which is funny because earlier today, after I got my laptop from FedEx, I specifically remember thinking things were going <i>too</i> smoothly. Like, a little too calm and uneventful.
          And just given that I've been in and out of damage control mode for feel the past few weeks, I was expecting something terrible to happen. Maybe I would get held at immigration when I landed in the US. Maybe my flight would be delayed due to wildfires in California. Maybe I would lose my keys. Maybe the taxi that I booked for my 6am flight wouldn't come.
          I wasn't sure what it was, but I felt like SOMETHING would go wrong because that's how my past month has been. Emotional whiplash could be a good way to put it.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
          Backtrack to July 8. I wrapped a project at work that I'd been stressing out about immensely to positive reception. The next week, a week away from my one year work anniversary, I found out, kind of out of nowhere that I had to move to Canada.
          When I got to Vancouver, I signed a beautiful apartment a couple days before I even expected to have a permanent living situation, then I got thrown into deliveries mayhem. I started a blog, got into a very tense conversation with my parents, figured out my intercom situation and wanted to spend a nice weekend drawing, and then my fucking bag got stolen in the cafe I really like(d?).
          I go into panic thinking my passport has been stolen and can't travel anymore. Realize my passport was in my apartment but might have been flagged as lost, have to wait until the next Tuesday to hear from the passport office, then finally I find out that by the grace of god my passport is still valid. My company shipped me a new laptop which was supposed to arrive on Tuesday, but it gets held at customs so I didn't get a laptop until today. And everything was going pretty smoothly until I realized I power-washed my intercom phone. I'm tired even typing all of that. Who knows what the future has in store for our (anti)heroine? Stay tuned.

          I did start boxing though. I definitely missed hitting things, but it's kind of exciting because the classes have partner drills, footwork, and more technique-focused instruction. And because of my highly vocal fondness of hitting things, I've been a bit negligent in the past aboutn my footwork and ability to react to incoming punches. But today, I didn't end up going to class. Instead I ate two pints of ice cream on the floor of my apartment, which is still very empty apart from a bedframe, a mattress, and a desk.

        Lisa was saying how she could see my life as a training montage. I'm not shy to wistful thinking, so I start to envision myself at some point in the future, emerging from the ashes of my exile as a Hot Girl. I remember reading essays online about the Cool Girl, or the Effortless White Woman. And I imagine what being a Hot Girl would really entail. I'd have k-pop star legs but could also fuck you up because I'd have boxed long enough to fight someone IRL. I'd look like Kendall Jenner and know how javascript works (sorry for coasting in WDD Jess, but at least I remembered enough to make this blog?). I would be literary and well-read because I would consistently find time to read. I would draw consistently too, both with a Muji pencil AND and Apple pencil. I'd be good at personal finance and making headway on my <a href="https://thecollegeinvestor.com/19862/fire-for-non-frugal-people/" target=+blank>FIRE goals</a>. I'd be a delight at cocktail parties because I could tell you about art, history, architecture, and trivia. When people talk about me, they'd say "Tina? Oh she's so nice and sweet, she's so knowledgeable, and she really glowed up too. I don't know how she does it." I'd be dating someone who wonders what they did to #trapmyass. But now I'm just being extra. Hot Girl starts with eating less, moving more, being great at my job, being thoughtful and kind, having interesting hobbies, and just having the discipline to follow through with the things I talk about. (Eating a family sized bag of chips, almost a box of maple cookies, 3 flavors of gourmet kit kat, plus the 2 pints of ice cream constitutes a low point though...and an entire swiss roll last night lol oh dear lord).

       I just found out I'm cleared for travel! True elation and relief. This is coming from someone who thinks I rarely feel happy. It’s an interesting concept.
       I don’t think people are meant to be happy all the time. I think a lot about being dissatisfied. My most recent trip to New York
       was weirdly emotionally charged, and after talking a lot about this with Khanh, I've just concluded (and resigned myself to the fact)
       that I am easily dissatisfied. And she felt the same way, and there isn't necessarily a way out of it, or ~action items~ that were doable.
     </p>
     <p class="entry">
       On the flip side, I feel happy in weird bursts too. Or maybe its satisfaction when I remember my life is actually going very well.
       Like on a nice day during golden hour when I’m ready to go on a long walk and the right music is playing.
     </p>
     <p class="entry">
       This is all to say, how fucking clutch. This situation would definitely have been much worse. What an emotional roller coaster this week has been. I certainly feel calmer now thinking about it in retrospect.

        It’s currently 5AM and I can’t sleep. I feel like I’m in knots.
        Like when you start mindlessly scribbling on paper and then look down and it’s just messy scratches and loops.
        I can’t quite find words to describe how I’m feeling right now, but it’s definitely negative.
        Irate, indignant, mildly nauseous, and my stomach feels like a pit.
    </p>
    <p class="entry">
        I’ve noticed I have been clenching my jaw a lot. Thank god for invisalign or I bet my teeth would be in terrible condition.

    <p class="entry">
        Part of the reason I am staying awake is because I just got off a call with my parents.
        Note to self: Don’t talk to parents about feelings. It historically has not ended well.
        They probably aren’t culturally familiar with the “listen to your feelings and extend sympathy” method, and it’s incredibly unhelpful to be given action items for an inactionable situation.
        It will end in some form of lecture, they will just tell you you’re not working hard enough (because as first generation, they got where they are now by working hard), you’ll start crying, and you’ll piss off your mom.
        Future correspondence should be sickeningly-falsely optimistic and be limited to status reports.

        Something about diamonds forming under pressure. Aside from the fact that diamonds are the result of price-fixing and monopolies, I’ve found that in times of stress I’ve always come out a bit better. I’m not really sure what it will look like right now, but I look forward to it, I guess.
    </p>
    <p class="entry">
        Right now, I don’t want to roll with the punches. I want to complain. And I want to my complaints to be be heard.

        Back in Fitness Land, I’m contemplating going to the gym to walk on the treadmill because I have nothing better to do.
        But I probably won’t because I think about things all the time and don’t follow through with them (I did, however, feel like I should write and now I am).
        It’s funny how bad people in general seem to be at making good decisions for the future.
        There’s no lack of knowledge out there on what people <i>ought</i> to do.
        Like I obviously should plug in my phone so it’s fully charged in the morning, but I also don’t want to move 2 feet to plug it in.
        Maybe that’s why I like behavioral economics so much, because I am a poster-child for irrationality and inconsistent preferences.

    <p class="entry">
        I didn’t end up eating yesterday because I didn’t really have an appetite, and this morning I looked a lot slimmer.
        Before I remember experiencing some weird satisfaction from not eating for as long as possible and now I just don’t care as much.
        I still want to be a Hot Girl (whatever that even means now), and I most certainly still have issues with my appearance, but a lot of my mental capacity has shifted to being miserable about other things.
        I <i>did</i> stress eat two bags of chips on Friday though so evened out I should be getting enough calories. I've also been eating lots of sweets (shout out to Purebread).
    </p>
    <p class="entry">
        I can’t really wrap my head around how I managed to spend 15+ hours working out at the peak of it.
        Like, what kind of fucking insane person does 40 miles of walking/jogging on top of 5 Barry’s classes in a week.
        Kind of impressed but also wtf @ me. I actually remember being secretly excited to have so much time to work out after coming to Vancouver, but now all I have to say is “lol. Jk.”
        I’m excited for the boxing gym to open though. Over more than a year, I’ve realized I don’t like working out but I <i>do</i> like hitting things.

        But yesterday I went to see fireworks at English Beach with some people in a group that ballooned beyond itself, and I remember it was enjoyable

          Today is Saturday and I'm writing from <a href="https://www.quantumcoffee.io/" target=_blank> Quantum Coffee</a>. It's my favorite cafe so far, as indicated by my filled loyalty card.
          After the long, drawn-out, crippling-anxiety-inducing battle to get my deliveries, I got a local number and a janky-ass LG phone to use as an intercom buzzer. So far I have successfully received 2 deliveries, including my mattress.

          My scalp is covered with scabs from the bleach burns I got when getting my root touch ups on Tuesday (you thought I was kidding about TMI? lol.). My scalp is starting to flake as the burns are healing too, to now it looks like I have gross, uncontrollable dandruff.
          But that's ok, because the color is great and is the color I think I've always wanted, but didn't know.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
          Today feels better, probably because I am not confined to my apartment. Starting this blog thing also helped, because I've always been good at making grand, sweeping proclamations, but bad at doing things.
          So following through and actually producing something feels good. Though now I'm realizing that there's no underlying architecture or CMS to this blog, and that it probably isn't scalable. Also I haven't bothered to put in spellcheck. But that's a problem for future Tina to deal with.

          I clearly remember something Mei said 2 or 3 years ago (where does the time go?), which was something along the lines of "being comfortable with your own company." It's something I've kept very close to my heart. It's interesting because for a lot of this year when I was still in the US, I felt <i>very</i> comfortable being alone.
          But now that I am more or less alone in Vancouver, it feels different in a very inexplicable way. I still like spending a day in a cafe. I'm writing now, but I can also spend hours of drawing and be perfectly content.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
          I'm not "GOING CRAZY", like I've typed to a bunch of people across various conversations. Deep down I know it's hyperbole. It's objectively not that bad.
          Objectively, it's not bad at all. Vancouver is objectively wonderful. The city is beautiful, the people are nice, and the weather is sunny and doesn't vary by 15 degrees C from morning to afternoon. The cafes are spacious, have good coffee, reliably have wifi and outlets, and are open much later. The harbor is beautiful. But I feel off. I think it's because, for all the time I spent with myself in SF, I never really felt lonely.
          More accurately, sometimes I did, but I was driven by the burning desire to eat less and move more (taken to extremes, lol). So being my myself it felt like a choice, and I was alone but not lonely. But now I feel a bit lonely.
      </p>
      <p class="entry mb2">
          I used to worry that my social skills were in decline, and I was incapable of holding conversations with people and maintain friendships with some people I knew I liked but didn't quite know how to talk to any more.
          I guess the one good thing about having to move was that I was forced to claw myself out of my anti-social pit, and got to spend time with a lot of people.
          It might have been the happiest I've been in a long time.
          It also showed me that I can still be extroverted, sociable and very pleasant when I want to. But right now I want to brood, and I'll let myself do it.
