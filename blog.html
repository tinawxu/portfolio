            August 04 — INTRO
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
            It all started Monday, July 16th, 2018 when I found out I didn't get an H1-B. It was some time in the afternoon, and my immediate reaction was "well, fuck me".
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
            But to be perfectly honest, I can't say I was surprised. I hadn't heard anything about my H1-B case and it was late July, so I had assumed that I wasn't going to get it. But some part of me was hoping for that last minute Hail Mary email from the lawyers — "Congrats!." Oh, here's a special fuck you to people who posted about getting their H1-B on facebook. Firstly, who even posts on facebook anymore? Secondly, go fuck yourself.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
            Resignation aside, the prospect of moving to a new city was kind of exciting. I had my fair share of complaints about San Francisco. Dare I say I was thankful for the chance to leave?
            On July 26, I left for Vancouver with a suitcase full of clothes, 10lbs heavier from eating like a rabid child at a birthday party for a week and a half.

      <p class="entry">
          It's been nearly a week. In an attempt to not waste away as I wait for the next H1-B cycle and the pursuit of ~new skills~, I've decided to add a blog section to my half-baked Generic Digital Designer Internet One-Pager.
          So I'm gonna write. And it's going to be angry. It's going to be how I feel during this emotional roller coaster that I dub my "Vancouver Exile".
          This will be full of my existential qualms and complaints, and honestly, some very first world problems. I know I will come off as a complete ingrate sometimes.
          I'm not going to hold myself to any reliable schedule either. So most posts will likely be written in times of high emotional duress. It might be TMI (though if you know about this blog link, it means I like you enough that I would have told you about this in person, or I guess via chat, anyway) and incredibly unorganized. But that's ok.
