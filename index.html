            I'm a Product Designer at Envoy. I'm passionate about behavior-centered design that is sensitive to quirks that make us human.
            I aspire to craft thoughtful, clever solutions to people's problems that also inject joy into their lives.
            Before design, I studied Economics and Psychology at UC Berkeley.<br>
            I'm trying to develop my own website. Until then, you can see my work
