            INTRO, August 04, 2018
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
            It all started Monday, July 16th, 2018 when I found out I didn't get an H1-B. It was some time in the afternoon, and my immediate reaction was "well, fuck me".
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
            But to be perfectly honest, I can't say I was surprised. I hadn't heard anything about my H1-B case and it was late July, so I had assumed that I wasn't going to get it. But some part of me was hoping for that last minute Hail Mary email from the lawyers — "Congrats!."
            But that never happened. Instead, my question about the cap-gap was answered by "Wait no you can't work anymore we just got your rejection notice."
            Oh, here's a special fuck you to people who posted about getting their H1-B on facebook. Firstly, who even posts on facebook anymore? Secondly, go fuck yourself.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
            Resignation aside, the prospect of moving to a new city was kind of exciting. I had my fair share of complaints about San Francisco. Dare I say I was thankful for the chance to leave?
            On July 26, I left for Vancouver with a suitcase full of clothes, 10lbs heavier from eating like a rabid child at a birthday party for a week and a half.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
          It's been nearly a week. In an attempt to not waste away as I wait for the next H1-B cycle and the pursuit of ~new skills~, I've decided to add a blog section to my half-baked Generic Digital Designer Internet One-Pager.
          So I'm gonna write. And it's going to be angry. It's going to be how I feel during this emotional roller coaster that I dub my "Vancouver Exile".
          This will be full of my existential qualms and complaints, and honestly, some very first world problems. I know I will come off as a complete ingrate sometimes.
          I'm not going to hold myself to any reliable schedule either. So most posts will likely be written in times of high emotional duress. Or when I feel like it. Like twitter. It might be TMI (though if you know about this blog link, it means I like you enough that I would have told you about this in person, or I guess via chat, anyway) and incredibly unorganized. But that's ok.

  <p class="entry">
    Routine doesn't really make for interesting writing. It's a long weekend and I'm pre-committing myself to writing a recap of thoughts from the previous while. Though I am debating whether to bring my laptop out with me to write in a cafe, I also want to read and draw a bit, and the recollection of Getting My Shit Stolen still stays with me. My laptop is safer at home. I also have a clear issue with letting go of certain things. A thought occured to me the other day when Jess sent a screencap of something to a group chat which made me think of the grievances I still hold. Perhaps because I'm still bothered. But I hope not. Or rather, I don't think I'm bothered by it. Maybe I just like playing the victim. No, that's also inaccurate because I don't feel like I'm self victimizing. The degree of my feelings don't warrant the label of self-victimization. I think it just sums up to me being petty. OK. Train of thought derailed yet again. But basically, I responded, "I don't bury hatchets, I use them to destroy my enemies," which again grossly exaggerated how I actually felt, but it was a quippy one-liner.
  </p>
  <p class="entry">
    In the past three days I've spent 8 hours on a treadmill. Though I made it a point to be active and walk more, a metaphorical fire was lit under my ass when I purchased a cinnamon roll on Wednesday (or Tuesday?). While there was nothing wrong with said cinnamon roll, it was very mediocre. But I still finished it. And somehow that translated into this huge lapse of #willpower that made me want to prove to myself that I have mental resolve. Cue  whimsical thought about walking 16 miles as a test of my will. But a lot of thoughts pass through my head and nothing ever comes out of them. But, still being very unoccupied and antisocial in Vancouver, I again, had nothing better to do, so I thought, "fuck it, lets go on a four hour walk." The first hour I listened to a SYSK podcast on...I think it was Medieval torture devices (LOL. For the record I didn't choose it I listen to them in order. I started from their first episode in 2008 and now I'm in 2013.) Then the next three hours were music. Around half way into the second hour, I think the endorphins hit and I just felt really giddy. Like I could do anything I wanted to. Like, a profound sense of excitement and elation that despite the fact that nothing exceptional was happening, <i> I </i> felt happy. During hour 3 I started to think about whether I wanted to just call it a day at 12 miles but then Jess sent the thing and I spun it into a "matter of principle" (as I do) and decided that as a testament to my character, I must walk on. Four hours of LISS is excessive, I know, but endorphins make you happy, and happy people don't shoot their husbands.
  </p>
  <p class="entry">
    SPEAKING OF WHICH. Hold. The. Fuck. Up. Because today it happened. Someone I know directly got married. Someone I met in Berkeley in the same year as me got married. Ugh. Cue thoughts about being a spinster forever then realizing that a) I'm 23 and getting married at 23 is an exception now, and b) Amal Alamuddin. Enough said. Spiral averted.
  </p>
  <p class="entry">
    Oh yes. I also watched <i>The Night is Short: Walk on Girl</i> during the last day of its run in the only theatre in Vancouver showing it.I considered not going but I'm incredibly pleased that I did. The theatre was packed and finding a seat as a party of one was actually so liberating. But I feel like solo movie nights could totally become a thing. And the movie was a lot of fun too. Super dynamic, colorful, fast-paced, and unpredictable. Just...wild. I don't know how else to the describe it. It felt like the plot was, well, not even twisting and winding. Think of a car barreling down a freeway, suddenly braking then speeding off in another direction, repeated again and again. Oh! Like the chase scenes in <i>Baby Driver</i>.  But back to <i>The Night is Short</i>, it definitely made my trip home through downtown Vancouver a lot more fantastical. On thing that stuck out to me though, was a bit of sadness when I thought about all of the word play and puns that I missed because I don't understand Japanese or the full extent of cultural context which I'm sure was applied in the movie. I thought about continuing Duolingo, or even getting around to memorizing the Korean alphabet (the thought of which initially occured a almost a year ago when I thought about being "productive" on a flight home to GZ), but even I know that realistically, I am not going to do that.
  <p class="entry">
    Uh...there's definitely more, but publishing this for now.

      I’m reading Leslie’s diary and I stopped at a line from the entry she wrote on her birthday.
    </p>
    <p class="entry">
      “I want breathtaking, soul shaking, earth shattering love.”
    </p>
    <p class="entry">
      I used to think about the concept of "true love" in a pretty detached/removed way, like someone at a museum looking at some rare artifact through thick-paned glass. Like, I believed it existed, and that some really, really lucky people would find it, but that most people, including me, would likely never experience it (or touch it, in this comparison). Maybe it's because I'm scared I'll never find it myself so I've preemptively dismissed the possibility of ever encountering it so that it isn't even something sensible to "want". But when I read this, also due to the way she penned (typed would be more accurate but doesn't sound as good) it, I feel some indescribable sensation inside me, because I want it too.
    </p>
    <p class="entry">
      Speaking of love, though, Sweater Weather remains one of my favorite love-related songs though now, it seems hard to find songs that <i>aren’t</i> about love in some way. Or maybe it’s just availability bias. I’m not known for wide and varied music tastes anyway. I don’t even feel like I count as a normie (Note for Yudi: LOL x100). But as much as I <i>want</i> to have new music to listen to, music discovery isn’t something I care enough to put time into. I just end up listening to the same playlists on repeat to the point where sometimes I can’t stand them. So podcasts are just easier to listen to, because every episode is different. But speaking of which, it’s Sunday, which means <a href=“https://betches.com/podcast-channel/diet-starts-tomorrow/“ target=_blank>Diet Starts Tomorrow</a> updates, and I’m obsessed with it. Day made. It’s the little things(?)
    </p>
    <p class="entry">
      But I like sweater weather a lot. The instrumentals are dreamy and the lyrics feel wanderlust-y and intimate, bordering sensual. Ugh I am NOT cut out to be a music critic. But point is, can someone hold both MY hands through the holes of my sweater?
    </p>
    <p class="entry">
      Also like Leslie, I’m not sleeping very well. It may be my new enthusiasm towards ~intense~ hydration (I’m not known for moderation) that wakes me up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. I can’t really sleep until past 11:30pm, wake up 1-3 times a night, and get out of bed at 7ish because I can’t sleep anymore. This was supposed to be the period of my life where I could treat my poor brain with the full 8 hours of sleep I’d been fantasizing about since Sleep Psychology scared me shitless about how my all-nighters and otherwise poor sleep decisions from college. A common phrase I liked but that also was 100% hyperbole was “I’ll sleep when I DIE,” and I remember smugly recounting the all-nighters before the exams I aced, and my ability to function, in my opinion, incredibly well on very little sleep.

    <p class="entry">
      As I think about how I’m going to spend today, Sonia messages me with a similar dilemma. The subway tracks at her station are being replaced, so she’s trapped in Morningside. I think about going to Quantum Coffee to work on an interview script revision and post for the design blog I have to do for work but we all know what happened the last time I went to Quantum. Maybe I could also bring <i>Homo Deus</i> and a notebook to sketch in. Again, way too ambitious. I’m not going to finish all my work, an entire book, AND draw. But maybe I like the appeal of choice, even though most times I set out for a cafe with multiple things to do, most of the things I brought with me ended up being extra weight. Choice constraints might be a better idea in this case.
    </p>
    <p class="entry">
      Theres a cluster of used bookstores on the way-ish to Quantum. I think it’s referred to as “Book Row”. I want to stay put in one place, so it would make sense to go to the bookstores first then stay in Quantum until close, but I also don’t want to haul a full bag of stuff to the movie I’m trying to watch at 7:10pm. Though I could also watch it on Tuesday after boxing. But I guess I’ll play it by ear? I’ll decide later. Less thinking, more doing.

        I'd like to state for the record that it would have been really easy for me to push this entry until tomorrow, but I didn't.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        Yesterday I made plans to explore beyond east downtown in an attempt to furnish and decorate my apartment. I have a lot of empty walls and of course the sensible thing is to cover it with posters, maps, or prints since I have no desire to add shelving (though the idea of me and a power drill is hilariously fitting but also decidedly frightening) and have written off being a plant mom despite my manager’s assurances (Wells is a Certified Plant Dad).
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        I decided on the Granville Island Public Market pretty easily because if Vancouver is Canadian Seattle, then the Granville Public Market is Pike Place. There are a couple used furniture places on the way too so I thought I would stop by. But that didn't end up happening because the furniture places weren't open when I passed them.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        And of course, the day I elect to be outdoors and ~do things~, it’s raining. But because I’ve pre-committed myself to following through with my plans, I am now On my way! to Granville Island.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        I was taking my trash down when I realized I forgot my umbrella. Because I was already in the basement where the trash room is, I considered rolling the dice on the the possibility I would get miserably rained on, but because of my newly found fixation with following through, I went all the way back upstairs and fetched my damn umbrella. Not like it would help much because it’s just a weak-ass drizzle and I am in the least waterproof shoes ever due to lack of choice. Godspeed, flyknits. I also forced myself to walk the stairs down after getting my umbrella because I told myself when I am going downstairs and not carrying a lot of things, I might as well get the steps in, because it is an investment in my future. Future Tina, I hope you’re happy.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        On the way to Granville Island, I pass Costco and see the food area. Big box stores that loss-lead with food are my weakness. Like IKEA. Maybe I’ll walk to IKEA at some point. But it’s barely past 9am, and the Costco food area isn’t open. Goodbye, my almost lover. But they have poutine. And soft serve. For $1.99. Sweet mother of god. But again, they aren’t open, and I told myself I would cut out dairy anyway. And French fries. Because I made a shaky verbal agreement with Yudi in Tokyo that I would not eat mediocre fries. Wellness is a scam.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        I cross a bridge on my way to Granville island. A combination of the drizzly weather, the other bridges I see to my left and right, the water (False Creek?), and the specific landscape of buildings, waterside parks, and sparse passerbyers reminds me a lot of when I went to Portland in senior year with Sueying and Mei. Before Mei arrived, Sueying and I walked from Laurelhurst-ish to downtown (surprise, surprise). And when I walked across the Brooklyn Bridge on an equally drizzly day my first time in New York.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        One thing I’ve found really endearing about Vancouver is how there are blackberry brambles everywhere. Seriously. Every. Fucking. Where. I guess since I was walking through a park, it just occurred to me that I could pick and eat them. So I did. At some point I passed this cute garden along my walking path with a bunch of tomato, pepper, and eggplant plants. Somewhere in the world, Tom Brady is breaking out into a cold sweat. I spot some pumpking and grape vines, but most importantly, i see a raspberry bush. I'm obsessed with raspberries but they are always really expensive. And I'm really intimidated by the old Cantonese grannies and grandpas that run the place near-ish my apartment that sells two clamshells for $1.49. Sad. Only after picking a handful of raspberries do I notice a sign asking people who didn’t plant or tend to the crops not touch them. Oops.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        I get to the market and it’s smaller than I expected, but the FRUIT! ALL THE FRUIT. Berries and stone fruit and beautiful produce and cheese and olive oils and fresh cut flowers and pastries and meat. I buy a carton of raspberries, since obviously the handful I more or else stole like a degenerate wasn’t enough, and walk around the market while munching on the raspberries. Around a fourth of the berries in my carton were kind of crushed (eye rolls), so the juice stains my fingers and I end up looking like the human version of that <a href="https://youtu.be/ru__6sQ_bpE" target=_blank>bunny that looks like a deranged murderer</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        I didn’t see any art, but I did see a silver bracelet and of course it’s $980. At this price, I could just buy a Chrome Hearts ring. I think “underwhelming like Araby” would be too obscure a reference to describe my artwork hunt. Plus it feels fake-literary since I only really read <I>Araby</I> because I had to in high school English.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        After the market, I end up idling through H-Mart, IGA, Wholefoods, and T&T. Do I visit grocery stores because I lack order in my life? Am I finding too much symbolism in things because I’m looking for control of my surroundings amidst an inability to see where I will be more than a year into the future? Am I just over-thinking?
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        I remembered I had to replace my intercom phone since I power-washed the last one, so I make a trip to a mall and associate is saying how they are low on stock for the phone and I quip “I’m not surprised, I run through them so fast.” We both laugh. The associate goes to the stockroom to get the phone, and I think about if and when I’ll meet the LOML. I’d like to think it will be in a cafe. In a bookstore? On the New York subway? I hope it will be completely unceremonious and ordinary. Maybe it will be a rainy day like today. Wait. That’s basically How I Met Your Mother…

        Caroline and I were chatting throughout the day and on her recommendation ’m going to watch The Night is Short: Walk On Girl tomorrow. I don’t remember the last time I watched a movie alone. In fact I don’t recall ever watching a movie alone. The last animated movie I watched was Kimi No Nawa on April 11, 2017 with Barb. Then I went to watch it again the next day with KShone and Manders. Second semester senior year Tina was such a drama queen.

        I have a pile of 10-something books to read, but of course, I want what I can’t have, so I went into a bookstore and bought more books and my evening is now dedicated to reading. I briefly contemplated putting myself on a treadmill for 3 hours because my watch didn’t fit as loosely as it usually does, but then I realized that I literally JUST spent money to purchase books to read. So reading it is.

      <p class="entry">
        People seem to be having fun on Instagram. Will my FOMO get better if I have K-pop star legs? How are they even related...? How will I get K-pop star legs if boxing is primarily upper body? I should do bicycles. Bicycles are hard to do when you’re also trying to read. I still don’t know how to ride a bike. Or drive. Oh boy.

        Its 7:23 am and I am awake. I don’t remember at what point I became a morning person. Sometimes I think about how I am now and how if I were like this in high school or college, I could have actually made my 8 and 9ams and maybe gotten more from my glasses.

        Routines are important so now I am preparing to go on a walk, but I don’t have a destination in mind.

      <p class="entry">
        After my bag got stolen my landlady brought over a potted orchid as a belated housewarming and “I’m sorry your stuff was stolen” gift. I named him Carl after Carl Linnaeus and Carl is dying. I followed the instructions and even googled more instructions but Carl has looked much better. I love plants and I’ve become the self-stylized “flower girl”, but I’ve never really owned plants aside from a potted carnation plant when I was in 4th grade. Which died. So I’ve never really even contemplated purchasing potted plants. Which means I have no desire to realize my flighty fancy of having an apartment full of plants a la #urbanjungle and #girlswithplants. I’m sorry Carl. It isn’t your fault.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        I wanted to take a shower and GUESS WHAT THERE WAS NO HOT WATER. Typical. But now I just summed it up to what it is at face value. The “universe” isn’t punishing me for some self-magnified moral failing, or cashing cheques on my character. It's not that deep or symbolic. There’s just no damn hot water.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        Sometimes I think about solipsism, and that all I really know to exist is me and what goes on in my mind. As far as I know, there are no thoughts, emotions, and experience aside from my own. Everything I experience, perceive, and know is really just the output of electrical activity in my brain. What if I’m not even typing? Is my laptop a physical object or do I just perceive it to be? Is anything real? What is the meaning of life? This is when I start to want cake so I don’t have to think about things like this. But I’m not having cake, I’m going to get coffee.

          I’m on a morning walk and I got sick and tired of my workout playlist so I’m listening to Vivaldi’s Four Seasons feeling like I am a girl on a mission. What mission is it? I’m not sure.

      <p class="entry">
        The theme of the day is training myself to be better at following through. Like putting away laundry. Yes I COULD do it later and maybe it’s not the biggest deal if I put it off until a couple days or even a damn week later. But biiiitch do it NOW.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        Maybe by training myself at doing neutral, non-time sensitive, actionable things as the thoughts occur will make it easier for me to do important things that don’t necessarily have a deadline. Like getting a Canadian credit card. Or replacing my intercom phone. Or expensing my expense-able costs. Or mailing in paperwork proving I was a non-resident alien in the US. Or setting up a Canadian retirement account. Oh my god my tax situation is going to be a hellish experience. I feel myself spiraling just thinking about it. I just want to buy a Chrome Hearts ring now to avoid thinking about my problems.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        I wonder if I will develop shopaholic tendencies. Oh I need to budget too. Oh fuck. I remember there was a time when I was so comfortable in a routine in the Bay Area despite always feeling a bit of dissatisfied with Bay Area Tech Monoculture. But when I’m in the Bay, my diet takes a hit so I want to be in Vancouver so I can live my WIP Hot Girl life, but when I am in Vancouver I miss all my friends and everyone else who has made my life better. Grass is truly greener. Shout out to people who are constantly dissatisfied, it’s hard.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        I also need to write some definition of Hot Girl because I feel like people misunderstand. Like yes it’s definitely about not being entirely pleased about my self image. But I don’t think I have low self esteem. I do a lot of things reasonably well, I’m generally very sweet and considerate and thoughtful, I’m reasonably good at my job, and am generally interesting. So I think I’m actually quite pleased with myself as a person. But I think because I’m so goal oriented and that I’ve wanted to lose weight and keep it off for a long time and haven’t been able to achieve it, it’s gotten tangled with a lot of things.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        I’m not objectively fat or anything. Like, I’m not ugly. I know I am worth a lot more than my appearance. But all of the other goals I’ve ever had came and went. I either achieved them or stopped caring about them, but Hot Girl is THE one. The one that I still care about and haven’t achieved successfully. So it’s escalated into a matter of principle. It’s evolved into a question of “why CAN’T I do it?”
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        I walk around all the time at home in China and I see these slim girls walking around. And it’s like hello same gene pool, there’s nothing genetically blocking me. I could be perfectly fine with my appearance but I don’t HAVE to look the way I do. Maybe it’s also my desire to be constantly feeling progress. I hate the feeling of regressing even though it’s inherent to life and especially losing weight.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        Oh also control issues. I am 100% positive that my diet is the cause of me not being able to lose weight. I eat so much I’m not even kidding. Like I know that sounds like bullshit because you see girls eating like a quarter of a chicken thigh and saying “oh I’m so full.” And maybe that’s the case, but for me the range between feeling satiated and being so full I can’t breathe is very broad. I can eat a lot and I do. And I don’t physically need that much food oh my god. But somehow it’s hard to control it. Like, when I buy those two pound packs of blueberries, I will eat the whole damn thing even if I feel satiated by two handfuls. And it’s not even a matter of whether blueberries are healthy or not. It’s like, do I need to finish two pounds of blueberries in a sitting? NO!!! So I’ve concluded my issues with food are a control and discipline and willpower issue that I have yet to get a handle on. Other than that I think I’m fine. *sips coffee with flames in the background*
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
        Oh also luck. A longer-standing goal that I eventually achieved was becoming a product designer. I became a product designer through a mix of hard work and luck. But there’s little room for luck in becoming a Hot Girl. It’s all me. So I could control it but I can’t or don’t. Which I think makes me more upset than not looking a certain way.

        I don’t just want to be a hot girl. I want to be a Hot Girl, because being a Hot Girl represents me being the master of my irrational, undisciplined, flimsy, control-loving destiny.

        Is this diary going to be my own personal confessional to all of my self proclaimed “moral failings”? I guess if we’re here, yesterday after dinner I bought halo top and ate maybe 3/4 of it before panic-throwing it into a trash bin and my 1.5 gen overseas Chinese core is shook at the fact that I wasted food I paid for. I also used to crush candy bars in the office. It started after I caught myself eating 10 in one sitting so the next day every time I wanted a candy bar, I would go get it and crush it so I would be “destroying it instead of it destroying MY GOALS”. At some point my manager noticed and he primed me a stress ball. Sounds like deeply rooted psychological issues but ok.

        I’m the prime candidate for commitment devices, which are physical things or general mechanisms that restrict your choices so you literally cannot make poor choices. Maybe that’s why Barrys worked so well. It was so expensive that I couldn’t miss a class and if I ate before or after I would feel sick because it was high intensity, or I felt because I busted ass that I shouldn’t destroy my “progress”.

          Damage control continues with one of my three pieces of luggage not making it to Vancouver. In a moment of weakness at YVR baggage claim at 11PM, I wondered if the “universe” was punishing me for being too salty to Arlan, then I got it together and I’m still not sorry. What an ass. Fuck that guy.

          I might be one of the least likely candidates for princess aspirations, but when something fairytale-like happens, I definitely catalog it mentally. One time, I was walking towards campus by underhill and Ankur was walking south towards me, and when we passed each other he picked me up and twirled me. I also always thought it was very sweet to look down from the balcony when Arlan came over to 2442 Piedmont. He’s still terrible though. What an ass. Fuck that guy.

         OK back from a major digression. Today I forgot my bus pass when going out to get my chair from the store, and the box the chair came in ended up being larger than I expected so I flagged a taxi to get it home. HOWEVER, the taxi that I flagged was actually reserved, but the driver took my anyway, and I felt really bad about it the entire time so I told the driver he didn’t need to make a U-turn to get to my side of the street. So I fumbled around trying to haul this big-ass chair box from out of the taxi trunk to my door. Mind you, it wasn’t heavy it was just large, but some very tall guy in a suit is in the middle of crossing the street and he sees me and picks up his pace and comes and picks up my chair box and asks me where I’m going. And I, of course, with my fixation with doing things for myself, say “No no, thank you! It’s ok I’m just going to 933.” And he says, “Oh don’t worry, I’m going there too, I’m not going to steal your chair.” So he helps me carry my chair and we chat a little, and his name is Aaron (?), he’s a law student who just finished his internship at a law firm, and he lives on the floor below me. He definitely reminded me of a Disney prince. Maybe a cross between Eric from The Little Mermaid and Philip from Sleeping Beauty? All of which is to say, not into it, but the gesture was very kind and was much appreciated. Honestly, everyone in Vancouver has been very nice so far. Except for the ass who took my bag. How terrible. Fuck that guy too.

        Today my parter was a girl named Jasmine, and the main drill included upper cuts, slips, and rolls. Before I think I was very into the idea of boxing because it was a Hot Girl thing to do, and because I was angry about a rotating selection of people and things. So I’ve always punched hard, but I’ve had terrible reaction times and footwork.

      <p class="entry">
           Ok. That's hyperbole, but it was BAD. The screen was cracked and bent beyond imaginable repair
           (as you'd expect for a $100 phone that was pummelled and waterlogged in a drum for an hour...speaking of which, throwing a person in a modified washing machine would be peak cruel and unusual torture).
           For some reason I popped the battery back in, and this miserable, broken phone still had enough in it for the flashlight to turn on. That's resilience (or good engineering, I guess?) if I've ever seen it. Honestly same. Me. Relatable content. Dear god. That was the second LG K4 phone I've gone through in a week.
           One stolen, one annhilated by my washing machine. Quarter life crisis indeed.

          Which is funny because earlier today, after I got my laptop from FedEx, I specifically remember thinking things were going <i>too</i> smoothly. Like, a little too calm and uneventful.
          And just given that I've been in and out of damage control mode for feel the past few weeks, I was expecting something terrible to happen. Maybe I would get held at immigration when I landed in the US. Maybe my flight would be delayed due to wildfires in California. Maybe I would lose my keys. Maybe the taxi that I booked for my 6am flight wouldn't come.
          I wasn't sure what it was, but I felt like SOMETHING would go wrong because that's how my past month has been. Emotional whiplash could be a good way to put it.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
          Backtrack to July 8. I wrapped a project at work that I'd been stressing out about immensely to positive reception. The next week, a week away from my one year work anniversary, I found out, kind of out of nowhere that I had to move to Canada.
          When I got to Vancouver, I signed a beautiful apartment a couple days before I even expected to have a permanent living situation, then I got thrown into deliveries mayhem. I started a blog, got into a very tense conversation with my parents, figured out my intercom situation and wanted to spend a nice weekend drawing, and then my fucking bag got stolen in the cafe I really like(d?).
          I go into panic thinking my passport has been stolen and can't travel anymore. Realize my passport was in my apartment but might have been flagged as lost, have to wait until the next Tuesday to hear from the passport office, then finally I find out that by the grace of god my passport is still valid. My company shipped me a new laptop which was supposed to arrive on Tuesday, but it gets held at customs so I didn't get a laptop until today. And everything was going pretty smoothly until I realized I power-washed my intercom phone.

          I did start boxing though. I definitely missed hitting things, but it's kind of exciting because the classes have partner drills, footwork, and more technique-focused instruction. And because of my highly vocal fondness of hitting things, I've been a bit negligent in the past about my footwork and ability to react to incoming punches. But today, I didn't end up going to class. Instead I ate two pints of ice cream on the floor of my apartment, which is still very empty apart from a bedframe, a mattress, and a desk.

        Lisa was saying how she could see my life as a training montage. I'm not shy to wistful thinking, so I start to envision myself at some point in the future, emerging from the ashes of my exile as a Hot Girl. I remember reading essays online about the Cool Girl, or the Effortless White Woman. And I imagine what being a Hot Girl would really entail. I'd have k-pop star legs but could also fuck you up because I'd have boxed long enough to fight someone IRL. I'd look like Kendall Jenner and know how javascript works (sorry for coasting in WDD Jess, but at least I remembered enough to make this blog?). I would be literary and well-read because I would consistently find time to read. I would draw consistently too, both with a Muji pencil AND an Apple pencil. I'd be good at personal finance and making headway on my <a href="https://thecollegeinvestor.com/19862/fire-for-non-frugal-people/" target=+blank>FIRE goals</a>. I'd be a delight at cocktail parties because I could tell you about art, history, architecture, and trivia. When people talk about me, they'd say "Tina? Oh she's so nice and sweet, she's so knowledgeable, and she really glowed up too. I don't know how she does it." I'd be dating someone who wonders what they did to #trapmyass.

        But now I'm just being extra. Hot Girl starts with eating less, moving more, being great at my job, being thoughtful and kind, having interesting hobbies, and just having the discipline to follow through with the things I talk about.

        Eating a family sized bag of chips, almost a box of maple cookies, 3 flavors of gourmet kit kat, plus the 2 pints of ice cream constitutes a low point though...and an entire swiss roll last night lol oh dear lord.

       I just found out I'm cleared for travel! True elation and relief. This is coming from someone who thinks I rarely feel happy. It’s an interesting concept.
       I don’t think people are meant to be happy all the time. I think a lot about being dissatisfied. My most recent trip to New York
       was weirdly emotionally charged, and after talking a lot about this with Khanh, I've just concluded (and resigned myself to the fact)
       that I am easily dissatisfied. And she felt the same way, and there isn't necessarily a way out of it, or ~action items~ that were doable.

     <p class="entry">
       On the flip side, I feel happy in weird bursts too. Or maybe its satisfaction when I remember my life is actually going very well.

        I can’t quite find words to describe how I’m feeling right now, but it’s definitely negative.

        Part of the reason I am staying awake is because I just got off a call with my parents.
        Note to self: Don’t talk to parents about feelings. It historically has not ended well.
        They probably aren’t culturally familiar with the “listen to your feelings and extend sympathy” method, and it’s incredibly unhelpful to be given action items for an inactionable situation.
        It will end in some form of lecture, they will just tell you you’re not working hard enough (because as first generation, they got where they are now by working hard), you’ll start crying, and you’ll piss off your mom.

        Back in Fitness Land, I’m contemplating going to the gym to walk on the treadmill because I have nothing better to do.
        But I probably won’t because I think about things all the time and don’t follow through with them (I did, however, feel like I should write and now I am).
        It’s funny how bad people in general seem to be at making good decisions for the future.
        There’s no lack of knowledge out there on what people <i>ought</i> to do.
        Like I obviously should plug in my phone so it’s fully charged in the morning, but I also don’t want to move 2 feet to plug it in.

        I didn’t end up eating yesterday because I didn’t really have an appetite, and this morning I looked a lot slimmer.
        Before I remember experiencing some weird satisfaction from not eating for as long as possible and now I just don’t care as much.
        I still want to be a Hot Girl (whatever that even means now), and I most certainly still have issues with my appearance, but a lot of my mental capacity has shifted to being miserable about other things.
        I <i>did</i> stress eat two bags of chips on Friday though so evened out I should be getting enough calories. I've also been eating lots of sweets (shout out to Purebread).

        Kind of impressed but also wtf @ me. I actually remember being secretly excited to have so much time to work out after coming to Vancouver, but now all I have to say is “lol. Jk.”
        I’m excited for the boxing gym to open though. Over more than a year, I’ve realized I don’t like working out but I <i>do</i> like hitting things.

          After the long, drawn-out, crippling-anxiety-inducing battle to get my deliveries, I got a local number and a janky-ass LG phone to use as an intercom buzzer. So far I have successfully received 2 deliveries, including my mattress.

          My scalp is covered with scabs from the bleach burns I got when getting my root touch ups on Tuesday (you thought I was kidding about TMI? lol.). My scalp is starting to flake as the burns are healing too, to now it looks like I have gross, uncontrollable dandruff.

          Today feels better, probably because I am not confined to my apartment. Starting this blog thing also helped, because I've always been good at making grand, sweeping proclamations, but bad at doing things.
          So following through and actually producing something feels good. Though now I'm realizing that there's no underlying architecture or CMS to this blog, and that it probably isn't scalable. Also I haven't bothered to put in spellcheck. But that's a problem for future Tina to deal with.

          I clearly remember something Mei said 2 or 3 years ago (where does the time go?), which was something along the lines of "being comfortable with your own company." It's something I've kept very close to my heart. It's interesting because for a lot of this year when I was still in the US, I felt <i>very</i> comfortable being alone.
          But now that I am more or less alone in Vancouver, it feels different in a very inexplicable way. I still like spending a day in a cafe. I'm writing now, but I can also spend hours of drawing and be perfectly content.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
          I'm not "GOING CRAZY", like I've typed to a bunch of people across various conversations. Deep down I know it's hyperbole. It's objectively not that bad.
          Objectively, it's not bad at all. Vancouver is objectively wonderful. The city is beautiful, the people are nice, and the weather is sunny and doesn't vary by 15 degrees C from morning to afternoon. The cafes are spacious, have good coffee, reliably have wifi and outlets, and are open much later. The harbor is beautiful. But I feel off. I think it's because, for all the time I spent with myself in SF, I never really felt lonely.
          More accurately, sometimes I did, but I was driven by the burning desire to eat less and move more (taken to extremes, lol). So being my myself it felt like a choice, and I was alone but not lonely. But now I feel a bit lonely.
      </p>
      <p class="entry mb2">
          I used to worry that my social skills were in decline, and I was incapable of holding conversations with people and maintain friendships with some people I knew I liked but didn't quite know how to talk to any more.
          I guess the one good thing about having to move was that I was forced to claw myself out of my anti-social pit, and got to spend time with a lot of people.
          It might have been the happiest I've been in a long time.
          It also showed me that I can still be extroverted, sociable and very pleasant when I want to. But right now I want to brood, and I'll let myself do it.
