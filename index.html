      ðŸ‘‹ HI THERE!
      </p>
      <p class="header">
            I'm Tina. I'm a designer and self-proclaimed economist.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
            I'm currently a Product Designer at <a href="https://www.envoy.com">Envoy</a> where I work on core product, enterprise, and growth.
      </p>
      <p class="body"> I'm passionate about behavior-centered design that is sensitive to quirks that make us human.
            I aspire to craft thoughtful, clever solutions to people's problems that also inject joy into their lives.
            Before design, I studied Economics and Psychology at UC Berkeley.
      </p>

            I'm trying to develop my own website. Until then, you can see my work <a href="https://www.tinaxu.com">here</a>.
