          I'm a Product Designer at Envoy. I graduated from UC Berkeley with degrees in Economics and Psychology. I'm passionate about behavior-centered design that is sensitive to quirks that make us human. I aspire to craft thoughtful, clever solutions to people's problems that also inject joy into their lives. I'm trying to develop my own website. LOL.
