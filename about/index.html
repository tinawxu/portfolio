        About me
      </p>
      <p class="body mt2">
        I got into design at age 6 when I redesigned outfits for the protagonists in Sailor Moon. Since then, I found an all-consuming love of all things visual.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        An interest in behavioral economics and human irrationality opened my eyes to how good design and information architecture could help take care of people and impact at scale. The marriage of behavioral economics with my love of the visual gave rise to a passion for product design. I hope to create considerate, empathetic products that have the userâ€™s best interests at heart and cut through cognitive clutter to build products that move individuals closer to their goals.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        Outside of design, I spend a lot of time illustrating, <a href="https://goodreads.com/tinawxu" target="_blank">reading</a>, and lurking on food blogs (<a href="https://goodreads.com/tinawxu" target="_blank">Lady and Pups</a> is my current favorite). I'm currently very invested in flower arranging and cake decorating videos on Instagram, and am almost certainly listening to <a href="https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts" target="_blank">Stuff You Should Know</a> or the <a href="http://freakonomics.com/archive/" target="_blank">Freakonomics Podcast</a>.
