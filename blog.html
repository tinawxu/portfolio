            INTRO

      <p class="entry">
            It all started Monday, July 16th, 2018 when I found out I didn't get an H1-B. It was some time in the afternoon, and my immediate reaction was "well, fuck me".
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
            But to be perfectly honest, I can't say I was surprised. I hadn't heard anything about my H1-B case and it was late July, so I had assumed that I wasn't going to get it. But some part of me was hoping for that last minute Hail Mary email from the lawyers — "Congrats!."
            But that never happened. Instead, my question about the cap-gap was answered by "Wait no you can't work anymore we just got your rejection notice."
            Oh, here's a special fuck you to people who posted about getting their H1-B on facebook. Firstly, who even posts on facebook anymore? Secondly, go fuck yourself.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
            Resignation aside, the prospect of moving to a new city was kind of exciting. I had my fair share of complaints about San Francisco. Dare I say I was thankful for the chance to leave?
            On July 26, I left for Vancouver with a suitcase full of clothes, 10lbs heavier from eating like a rabid child at a birthday party for a week and a half.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
          It's been nearly a week. In an attempt to not waste away as I wait for the next H1-B cycle and the pursuit of ~new skills~, I've decided to add a blog section to my half-baked Generic Digital Designer Internet One-Pager.
          So I'm gonna write. And it's going to be angry. It's going to be how I feel during this emotional roller coaster that I dub my "Vancouver Exile".
          This will be full of my existential qualms and complaints, and honestly, some very first world problems. I know I will come off as a complete ingrate sometimes.
          I'm not going to hold myself to any reliable schedule either. So most posts will likely be written in times of high emotional duress. Or when I feel like it. Like twitter. It might be TMI (though if you know about this blog link, it means I like you enough that I would have told you about this in person, or I guess via chat, anyway) and incredibly unorganized. But that's ok.

          AUGUST 04, 2018
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
          Today is Saturday and I'm writing from <a href="https://www.quantumcoffee.io/" target=_blank> Quantum Coffee</a>. It's my favorite cafe so far, as indicated by my filled loyalty card.
          After the long, drawn-out , crippling-anxiety-inducing battle to get my deliveries, I got a local number and a janky-ass LG phone to use as an intercom buzzer. So far I have successfully received 2 deliveries, including my mattress.

          My scalp is covered with scabs from the bleach burns I got when getting my root touch ups on Tuesday (you thought I was kidding about TMI? lol.). My scalp is starting to flake as the burns are healing too, to now it looks like I have gross, uncontrollable dandruff.
          But that's ok, because the color is great and is the color I think I've always wanted, but didn't know.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
          Today feels better, probably because I am not confined to my apartment. Starting this blog thing also helped, because I've always been good at making grand, sweeping proclamations, but bad at doing things.
          So following through and actually producing something feels good. Though now I'm realizing that there's no underlying architecture or CMS to this blog, and that it probably isn't scalable. Also I haven't bothered to put in spellcheck. But that's a problem for future Tina to deal with.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
          I clearly remember something Mei said 2 or 3 years ago (where does the time go?), which was something along the lines of "being comfortable with your own company." It's something I've kept very close to my heart. It's interesting because for a lot of this year when I was still in the US, I felt <i>very</i> comfortable being alone.
          But now that I am more or less alone in Vancouver, it feels different in a very inexplicable way. I still like spending a day in a cafe. I'm writing now, but I can also spend hours of drawing and be perfectly content.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
          I'm not "GOING CRAZY", like I've typed to a bunch of people across various conversations. Deep down I know it's hyperbole. It's objectively not that bad.
          Objectively, it's not bad at all. Vancouver is objectively wonderful. The city is beautiful, the people are nice, and the weather is sunny and doesn't vary by 15 degrees C from morning to afternoon. The cafes are spacious, have good coffee, reliably have wifi and outlets, and are open much later. The harbor is beautiful. But I feel off. I think it's because, for all the time I spent with myself in SF, I never really felt lonely.
          More accurately, sometimes I did, but I was driven by the burning desire to eat less and move more (taken to extremes, lol). So being my myself it felt like a choice, and I was alone but not lonely. But now I feel a bit lonely.
      </p>
      <p class="entry">
          I used to worry that my social skills were in decline, and I was incapable of holding conversations with people and maintain friendships with some people I knew I liked but didn't quite know how to talk to any more.
          I guess the one good thing about having to move was that I was forced to claw myself out of my anti-social pit, and got to spend time with a lot of people.
          It might have been the happiest I've been in a long time.
          It also showed me that I can still be extroverted, sociable and very pleasant when I want to. But right now I want to brood, and I'll let myself do it.
